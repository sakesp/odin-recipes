# odin-recipes
***
This is the first project I've come to in The Odin Project Foundations Course. I will practice some HTML while making a site with some recipes on it. I will be practicing using elements and tag, HTML boilerplate, lists, links and images. In the future I will make the site look nicer when I learn some CSS. Bye.
