    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef Brisket is a popular food. It is meat. Completely meat. The best brisket can be very very good.
        However much of the bricket you find in the wild is either too chewy or too dry. An ancient monastic tradition from the land of Texas
        has perfected the making of brisket in wood burning cookers. There is also a separate and even more ancient Abrahmic 
        tradition passed down by grandmothers in which the brisket is cooked in a moist enviroment in an indoor oven.
    </p>
    <p>The key to cooking good brisket is to cook it until all the connective tissue has broken
        down but to not cook is so harshly that the protiens synch up and leave the meat with no more 
        moisture. This recipe has the letters BBQ in the name to signify that the meat will will 
        be exposed to combustible carbon if the form of wood or charcoal. This recipe also contains the 
        word "Easier" because traditional Texas BBQ requires the stoaking of a fire outside for anywhere
        from 10-18 hour. Many traditional BBQ pitmasters however, wrap the briskets after some amount of time
        to make the brisket cook faster and to prevent moisture loss. This recipe will be easier 
        because at the point of wrapping we will take the brisket inside to the home oven and cook it low and slow
        until it is done.
