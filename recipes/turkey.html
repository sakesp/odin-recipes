    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Turkey is a fowl. Often eaten on holidays as a matter of tradition. 
        Although wild turkey are still to be found, the turkey found on 
        tables is a farm raised bird bred for excellent meat production.
        Turkey is not as popular as chicken, possibly due to it's imposing 
        form factor and tendency to be overcooked by frantic holiday chefs.
    </p>
    <p>The keys to cooking a desirable turkey are to season it well and to cook it 
        in a way so that the deepest meat is cooked before the outermost meat is 
        overcooked. This can be achieved by the use of a lower cooking temp in a 
        moist environment, an oven bag, frequent basting, or cutting the carcass 
        into smaller pieces so it will cook more evenly.
