    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mashed Potatoes are a simple food that are often served as a side dish. Just as with their 
        deriviative un-mashed potatoes they are highly nutritious and are well tolerated by
        descerning palates. The one attribute some people on the more texture sensitive side may find
        unappealing is the mashedness of the potatoes, which the detractors may label gooey,
        ploppy, slimey, mushy, or even of the defacatory nature.</p>
    <p>The keys to making good mashed potatoes are to not boil your potatoes until they 
        fall apart and separately to manage the consistency and flavor of the final product with the use of 
        add ins such as butter, milk, buttermilk, half and half, heavy cream, chicken stock, water, or cheeses. </p>
